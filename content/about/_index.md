# I make the bleep bloops
![Black & white portrait of my face](/me.jpg "My face")
Hi! I'm Phil. I've been making music on & off as a hobby for the last few
decades, but in early 2021, decided to take it a bit more seriously; making
more of an effort to try and impart a little more artistry and production value
into my work, and actually release some of it. I work out of my "home studio"
in London, which is essentially a fancy way of saying "I have a MIDI keyboard
and a microphone hooked up to my PC".

My music is mostly electronic, and mostly sequenced. When I started I thought I
was going to produce a mixture of synthwave and late 90s/early 2000s
dance music/techno type stuff; then I started writing lyrics and realised I
love it, so I write a lot of songs too. Also the weird & emotional aspects of
my personality crept in, and I decided very early on that I wouldn't try to
identify strictly as any particular genre; both decisions I feel awesome about.

I started this site for several reasons. Firstly, my main social media presence
is on Twitter, but I am utterly incapable of being concise, so wanted somewhere
to occasionally post longer-form content. Secondly, my attention tends to come
and go in cycles: I might have a laser focus on one particular thing for a few
months, then take a break from it for several more before coming back to it. So
the pace of my releases has definitely slowed, but I still want somewhere to
create & share musical and artistic stuff, even if that stuff doesn't take the
form of a traditional single, EP, or album.

Thirdly, I'm a massive nerd. This is a hobby for me: I'm learning everything as
I go, and occasionally just think something I've figured out is cool, and want
to write about what I'm up to.

Welcome!
