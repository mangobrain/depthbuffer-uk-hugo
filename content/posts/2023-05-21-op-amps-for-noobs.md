This article is part of my series on building a Eurorack audio amplifier, to
go from line-out on a field recorder or Raspberry Pi to my modular synth rack.
To start from the beginning, [click here](/posts/2023-05-21-babys-first-amplifier/).

This is part of my [Memento Potato project](/posts/2023-04-22-memento-potato/),
in which I am ostensibly producing [my third album](https://depthbuffer.bandcamp.com/album/memento-potato) and releasing each track as & when it's done,
but also using it as a vehicle for tons of other things I've wanted to
build/film/explain/nerd out about along the way.

## Operational Amplifiers

To recap: we know why our line-out audio is so quiet when piped into the rack,
we've reconciled ourselves to the jank of Eurorack on the basis that it is
_artisanal jank_ that makes it incredibly DIY friendly, and we've used the
hydraulic analogy to build a practical power interface between the rack and a
breadboard; one that is _robust enough for our purposes_ against whatever
other modules nearby are doing to the power rails and won't blow up if we attach
it backwards. But we still haven't done anything about actually boosting our
audio levels.

For that, we'll need the fourth of the four component types I listed in the
intro: _operational amplifiers_, or op-amps for short. I won't go into _how_
an op-amp works - partly because I don't actually know myself; partly because
this article series is already too large and has taken too long to write, so I have to
draw the line somewhere - but will cover _what they do_, and how we can coerce
their behaviour into something useful & controllable.

![Block diagram for an op-amp including power pins >](/article-images/diy-amp/op-amp.png)

![Circuit diagram symbol for an op-amp without power pins >](/article-images/diy-amp/op-amp-symbol.png)

Op-amps have two inputs - the _inverting_ input (V-), and the
_non-inverting input_ (V+) - and a single output (Vout), that outputs the
_difference_ between the two, multiplied by a very large number.

They are an _active_ component, in contrast to resistors, capacitors, and diodes, which
are all _passive_ components: this means that in order to work, they need a
power supply separate from the input signal, shown here by Vs+ and Vs-. These
last two wires are often not shown on circuit diagrams, which confused me
greatly to begin with. In the real world, they typically come packaged in the
form of chips containing multiple op-amps, all driven from the same two power
pins; so in diagrams, the power pins are either just assumed from context (if
the circuit has a Â±12V power supply, then unless explicitly mentioned, it's
most likely hooked up so Vs+ = +12V and Vs- = -12V), or a block representing
the actual chip itself will be drawn on a separate diagram showing just the
power pins, leaving the "functional" diagram to only worry about the inputs,
outputs, and labelling which physical chip each op-amp comes from.

### Open-loop Comparator

I digress. Getting back to the matter at hand: the output is the difference
between the inputs, multiplied by something large. ___Vout = G(V+ - V-)___,
where G is, for all practical purposes, basically infinite. Large enough that
if you just keep V- stuck at zero, then for any V+ above zero, Vout will be
some large positive voltage (in reality, limited by the type of op-amp, and
not bigger than the supply voltage Vs+); and for any V+ below zero, Vout will
be some large negative voltage. You won't realistically be able to exert fine
control over Vout by varying V+, because G is so big, that you would need to
vary it by infeasibly teeny tiny increments. Forget about even trying. A
hypothetical perfect op-amp that can swing its output fully from Vs+ to Vs-
would basically give us a sine-wave to square-wave converter that ignores
input volume:

![An open-loop comparator](/article-images/diy-amp/open-loop-comparator.png)

### From Comparator to Buffer: Feedback

That doesn't sound all that useful to us, does it? We want something that can
output an amplified copy of an input signal, but all we have is something that
will compare the signal to zero and flip between high and low voltages. How do
we bring this thing under control? The trick, dear reader, lies in _feedback_:
by feeding the op-amp's output back into itself, we can generate a Vout that
mimics Vin.

* Our equation - __Vout = G(V+ - V-)__ - only really works for the non-feedback
  case shown above. Introducing a feedback loop as shown below makes things
  _really_ interesting, because it actually becomes __Vout = G(V+ - Vout)__.
* Because of the loop, V+, V-, and Vout always change together. Instead of the
  output just slamming between the rails, the behaviour becomes:
  * __When V+ is higher than V-, Vout (and hence future V-) will go up__
  * __When V+ is lower than V-, Vout (and hence future V-) will go down__
  * __When V+ = V-, Vout stops changing__
* Effectively, the op-amp "wants" to satisfy __V+ = V- = Vout__, and will swing
  Vout as necessary to make that true.
* We call this _negative feedback_ because we're feeding the output back into
  the op-amp's inverting input.

![An op-amp buffer](/article-images/diy-amp/buffer.png)

So now we have a circuit that produces an exact copy of V+ on Vout! How is this
any more useful than just, you know, a plain old piece of wire? Well:

1. The power for the output signal is coming from the op-amp's power supply,
   not the input signal. Op-amps consume very little current on their inputs,
   and can supply relatively large currents on their outputs; so if you want an
   entire power-hungry analogue circuit in a Eurorack module, but don't want
   to try and power the whole thing by drawing current from whatever module
   is hooked up to your input jack (which it probably isn't designed to supply,
   so may burn it out), this kind of __input buffer__ is a good idea.
2. This is just the beginning. Now that we are using feedback and the difference
   between two points to duplicate a signal, by creatively manipulating the
   feedback path, we can control the magnitude of the difference, and make it
   do more interesting things.

### From Buffer to Amplifier: Voltage Dividers

Let's reconsider our equalities above. Once we introduce feedback, I said that
the op-amp wants to vary Vout to satisfy __V+ = V- = Vout__. But strictly speaking,
to stabilise, it only really needs to satisfy __V+ = V-__. The path from the output pin
back to the V- pin involves an extra loop of wire that Vout itself doesn't have
to travel over, and there's nothing stopping us putting stuff along that path.

![A volume-doubling amplifier based on a magic voltage-halving box and negative feedback >](/article-images/diy-amp/magic-amp.png)

Say we want an amplifier that will double the volume of our audio. We have a
circuit that wants to satisfy V+ = V-, and we know theoretically we can force
__Vout = X(V-)__ for some controllable value of X, by jamming components into
the feedback path.
If we set X to 0.5 - i.e. future V- is always half the
value of Vout - then at the point where V+ = V-, __Vout will be double the value
of V+__. We've forced it to satisfy __both V+ = V- and Vout = 2 * V-
simultaneously__, whilst running in an infinite loop where future V- is
constantly set to half of Vout.

So for V+ = 5, for example, when the circuit stabilises at V- = 5, Vout is 10.

What's inside our magic voltage-halving box? Think of the hydraulic analogy
again: if we have water flowing at a given rate through a pipe, and we want
to lower the water pressure, then we widen the pipe. Or, getting creative: we
create a T-junction, and allow some of the water to bleed off to ground through
a narrow pipe. By controlling the width of the initial pipe flowing into the
T-junction, and the width of the bleed-off pipe, we can control what proportion
of the original water pressure will make it through the junction, regardless of
flow rate.

![A hydraulic analogy for a voltage divider](/article-images/diy-amp/hydraulic-divider.png)

How do we build such a thing electronically? As mentioned earlier, in the
hydraulic analogy, our electronic "pipe narrowers" are resistors, and a pair of
resistors in this kind of configuration - one in series with our load, one in
parallel with ground/the path back to the opposite supply terminal - forms a
[voltage divider](http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/Voltage-divider-calculator.php).

By dividing the voltage by 2 along the feedback path, we force V- to always be
half of Vout; so when the op-amp stabilises at V+ = V-, Vout = 2 * Vin.

Again, there is no magical free energy here: the additional voltage is pulled
from the op-amp's power supply, and the output can't swing higher or lower than
the supply rails. (Exactly how close it will get varies across models of
op-amp.)

The equations in the voltage divider calculator linked above aren't _quite_
what we want when used in this configuration, because __maths__. The good news
is the gain equation for a non-inverting amplifier actually ends up being
[even simpler](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/opamp/opamp_3.html).

### Building Block the Second: Non-Inverting Amplifiers

![A non-inverting amplifier with a gain of 2](/article-images/diy-amp/op-amp-doubler.png)

This is our second re-usable building block: a ___non-inverting amplifier___
(the signal isn't flipped upside down), with a fixed ___gain___ (the amount the
signal is multiplied by) set by a ___voltage divider___ in the feedback path.

In fact, voltage dividers kind of qualify as a bonus building block in and of
themselves; but here, they're just a means to an end: by controlling the ratio
of V- to Vout, we in turn control the ratio of V+ - our input signal - to Vout.

## TL07x Rules of Thumb

In the real world, two very-commonly used models of op-amp in Eurorack modules
are the __TL072CP__ and __TL074CN__. These are incredibly cheap, well-stocked
op-amp chips; the TL072CP contains 2 op-amps, and the
TL074CN contains 4, and in both cases a single pair of power pins drives all
the op-amps inside the chip.

![A TL072CP and a TL074CN >](/article-images/diy-amp/tl07xx.jpg)

* They can happily accept Â±12V on their power pins
* Their "common mode" operation - i.e. the range in which they operate as
  expected, without weird quirks like suddenly swinging the output all the way
  to the opposite rail - expects the following rules to be obeyed:
  * At least 4.5V difference between positive and negative power pins
  * Input voltage not below Vs- + 4V. So when Vs- = -12V, don't use inputs
    lower than -8V.
  * Input voltage not above Vs+ + 0.1V.
* In complex circuits, and/or if the traces between the power supply and power
  pins are large, place 0.1ÂµF capacitors close to the power pins; one leg on
  the power rail, the other going to ground.
  * These form low-pass filters, removing any
    high-frequency noise on the power rails, giving stable supply voltages and
    reducing noise in the chip's operation.
  * If you have the space and the parts, these are generally considered
    mandatory. I haven't put them in this particular level booster partly
    because I was being lazy, and partly because the op-amp chip is literally
    the only thing in the circuit after the power conditioning, so I figured it
    would already be pretty noise-free. It seems to be Good Enough for my
    purposes.
* Don't short the outputs to ground.
  * I haven't mentioned Ohm's law yet, but we'll see it again later:
    __V = IR__, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.
    To continue supplying a constant voltage, if resistance drops, current
    goes up, and it's usually high currents that heat things up and release the
    magic smoke! If an op-amp is trying to supply 10V directly to ground, via
    a bare length of wire, current will go up, heat will go up, and chip will
    go bang.
  * Strictly speaking, the Texas Instruments TL072CPs and TL074CNs I and many
    others use include _current-limiting resistors_ on their output pins,
    internal to the chips themselves, to stop
    too much current flowing in a short-circuit scenario: they'll get warm, and
    be more power-hungry than they could be, but shouldn't damage themselves.
  * However, to be extra sure - and because outputs are _always_ momentarily
    shorted to ground when plugging patch cables in, and because we might be
    connecting the output to a poorly-designed, power-hungry module that doesn't
    use an input buffer, preferring to draw current directly from its input
    signal - it's good practice to add your own additional 1K current-limiting
    resistors in between the output pins and jack sockets.
* When picking resistor values for gain setting, the final gain is determined
  by [how the resistors relate to each other](http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/Voltage-divider-calculator.php);
  so in theory, a pair of 10â¦ resistors, a pair of 100â¦ resistors, or a pair of
  1Kâ¦ resistors will all give you a gain of 2. So which should you choose?
  * Prefer resistors in the Kâ¦ range. Again, this comes back to Ohm's law; we
    know the voltages we're working are in the single-digit/low-double-digit
    figures, and the chips expect currents in the milliamp range, so to line
    everything up we want resistances in the kilo-ohm range. If our resistances
    are orders of magnitude out, then our currents will also be orders of
    magnitude out, if we demand that the chip output the same voltages.
  * In fact, the data sheet for the TI parts literally states, "Selecting a value
    in the kilohm range is desirable because the amplifier circuit uses currents
    in the milliamp range. This ensures the part does not draw too much current."
* Don't leave unconnected inputs floating.
  * In a non-inverting amplifier like the above, one input is always used, as
    it's connected to the feedback loop; but the other input should always be
    connected to either signal or ground, not just left disconnected. Left
    disconnected, it'll be picking up random noisy voltages from any passing
    interference, and constantly trying to amplify them, instead of sat there
    happily outputting 0.
  * The design of 3.5mm jack sockets helps with this: they can easily be wired
    up such that when no jack is inserted, the signal pin makes contact with
    a "normal" pin; simply solder the normal pin & ground pin together to
    ground.
    * Only do this on your input jacks, not output jacks! For inputs, you
      _want_ them connected to ground when nothing is connected; for outputs,
      this just means any unconnected output jacks become a short to ground,
      which as discussed, is bad.
      The outputs don't have any problem with "floating" in the
      same way as the inputs do, because their values are actively driven by
      the amp. I initially _did_ short the normal & ground pins of my output
      jacks, and can confirm that the op-amp IC got uncomfortably warm in
      operation, and the problem went away after de-soldering these connections.

I leave it as an exercise for the reader to divine the rules of thumb above
from [TI's official datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tl074.pdf).
It's dense and obtuse, but it's all in there, if you know where to look; and
lots more besides.

Coming back to Eurorack's _artisanal jank_: given that these particular models
of op-amp are cheap as chips (pun not intended), happily accept Â±12V, and will
very happily output Eurorack signal levels (0..8V for envelopes, -2.5..+2.5V or
-5..+5V for control voltage, 0..8V for pitch, -5V..+5V for audio, etc.), I
suspect that the overlap between the price and these design parameters is not
an accident. Even the physical form factors are a good fit, as they're available
in rectangular packages with two rows of nice chonky pins, that can easily be
either hand-soldered directly through holes in a PCB, or inserted into a
(similarly hand-solderable) socket for easy repairability, or even jammed
directly into a breadboard (as long as you make sure the rows of pins are on
opposite halves, so you aren't shorting them all to each other).

Even if Doepfer didn't specifically have the TL072CP and TL074CN on hand when
designing the original modules, they seem like a good starting point for any
application other than precision manipulation of control voltage. I am NOT an
experienced designer, but I'm tempted to say always try prototyping with them
and decide if you need something more expensive later. (More expensive op-amps
might allow output voltage to swing closer to the supply rails, or have lower
noise floors, or have lower offset voltage - a small non-zero amount always
added to the output, etc.)

## 3.5mm Mono Jack Sockets

These things are essential for actually getting any sound into or out of the
amplifier, and very conveniently designed, but every time I look at the symbol
for one in a circuit diagram I get very confused.

![The confusing circuit diagram symbol for a 3.5mm jack socket](/article-images/diy-amp/confusing-jack.png)

I find it helps to remember that it is not drawn to scale. If it was, the
ground ring would be much further away from the ends of the pins, and the pins
would be spaced out more like they are on the actual physical socket:

![An imaginary to-scale jack socket diagram](/article-images/diy-amp/jack-to-scale.png)

This is of course not what the internal construction looks like, but it helps
me get my head around it.

1. Pin 1 is the ground ring, which connects to the sleeve/ground plate on the
   jack connector.
2. Pin 2 is the "normal" pin. If you want to have a specific voltage/signal
   from elsewhere in your circuit act as a "default input" when no patch cable
   is plugged in, connect it here.
   * Pins 1 and 2 are - at least, on a [Thonkiconn](https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/thonkiconn/),
     as pictured above - close enough to easily bridge them with a blob of solder.
   * To repeat some of my rules of thumb from earlier, which are definitely
     applicable to this amplifier design, and probably pretty broadly applicable
     in general:
       * You _do_ want to connect pin 2 to ground on your
         _input_ sockets, to stop the input pins of your buffer/amp/whatever IC from
         floating and just sending noise into the chip
       * You do _not_ want to do
         this on your _output_ sockets, or you'll be short-circuiting the output of
         your last component to ground whenever no cable is plugged in, needlessly
         consuming power and possibly releasing the magic smoke.
3. Pin 3 is the signal pin. When no jack is inserted, it makes contact with pin
   2; with a jack inserted, that connection is broken, and it connects to the
   tip of the jack instead.
