The little video at the end of my last post hinted that a full track would be
coming soon, and [it's here](https://depthbuffer.bandcamp.com/album/stardust).
As per the liner notes, this is an unapologetically cheesy track. It does not
pretend to break any musical ground, but instead basks in the clich√©s of
mid-90s mainstream dance, aiming to evoke memories of
[one-hit](https://youtu.be/s4oZdUV-G-Y) [wonders](https://youtu.be/qmsbP13xu6k)
from the [era](https://youtu.be/XCbAEkfXSDE) and infuse them with a bit of
TB-303 goodness.

(Aside: does Bablyon Zoo's Spaceman count as a troll track? I always remember
the sped-up, almost breakbeat sections before the 30 second mark and after
3:30, and none of the weird stuff in the middle.
[This is more like it](https://youtu.be/VukxfnrJaYQ).)

Anyway, shortly after releasing the track, I stumbled across
[this article on "ear candy" production tricks](https://www.musicradar.com/how-to/ear-candy-daw-music-production-tricks),
and realised that in the unabashed pursuit of style over substance, I've used
four of the six in this very track. I thought I'd share some others I'm quite
fond of as well.

# Pitch & formant shifting

MusicRadar count these as two separate tricks, but really, they're just
different settings on the same plugin - or at least, that's the case for both
Little AlterBoy (pictured in their article), and the similar Waves Vocal
Bender, which I use because I got it at a steep discount & it does the job.

For Stardust, I took the pitch up an octave, the formants _down_ three
semitones (I was going for "dusky", not Spaceman sped-up), and blended it
back in with the dry vocal at around 30%, increased to 50% during the two
"chorus" sections. If they can really be called that.

Honourable mention: it's not the kind of pitch-shifting they're talking about,
but I also used an auto-tune editor to produce the three different tunings of
the word "dust" from a single take (starting at 0:43 in the "radio edit"
version). I also use vocal stutter effects towards the end, which MusicRadar
warns "might have a tendency to date your mix" - which, in this case, is
exactly what I was going for!

# Reverse reverb

I didn't use this one here, but I've used similar tricks in the past, in
particular taking sounds with nice long tails - gongs, crash cymbals, etc. -
and reversing them, then playing that during the build-up to the "real" hit
at the start of the next bar. [Soundtrackers](https://youtu.be/roBkg-iPrbw) are
at heart just fancy samples, and Renoise is at heart just a fancy soundtracker,
so that kind of sample manipulation is trivial.

# Vocoding

Again, didn't use this one here, but I'm a big fan. Done it before; will
definitely do it again. I second their suggestion to use carrier sounds with
lots of harmonics (or "rich spectral content" as they put it), and experiment
with carrier _harmonies_ rather than limit yourself to one note at a time.

# Multi-tap delays

Yep. Went a bit overboard with this one on this track. At one point, the 303
is layered through Minimonsta's built-in delay, a "gapper" that basically
selectively drops small sections of the sound, followed by two other multi-tap
delays: a slow spacious one as an alternative to reverb, adding a sense of
scale; and a much shorter one added in later sections to change things up.

## Bonus: automating the mix of multiple effects in Renoise

Renoise has limitations on sends/inserts, but I have a favourite trick to work
around those when you want to blend effects that don't have a built in wet/dry
control: put your "dry" sound in a track group, with the effects you want to
blend on other tracks within the group, then use a sidechain device on the
dry track & a receiver such as [MRatio](https://www.meldaproduction.com/MRatio)
on the FX tracks to provide them their input. You can then automate the levels
of the effects by automating either the sidechain send level, or the receiver
level; plus you can add "bus-wide" effects over the whole lot by putting them
on the group itself.

# Master FX

Yep. For the "fade in" at the start of the track, I used two things on the
master bus: a simple notch filter with a descending cut-off frequency, and
AudioThing's [Wires](https://www.audiothing.net/effects/wires/), which provides
further gritty degradation, as well as the tape start effect right at the very
beginning, courtesy of automating flipping the playback start/stop switch in
the bottom right.

I picked up both Wires and Reels in a recent sale, and am not embarrassed to
say I think I've used multiple instances of both - sometimes in series on the
same sound - in every track I've worked on since.

## Exciters and Widening

Two of my favourite things to put on the master bus recently are exciters and
stereo wideners. Both have to be used sparingly. The former, if over-applied,
can make everything sound tinny and harsh. The latter, depending on the kind of
widening implemented, can risk introducing unwanted phase shift and risk
[phase cancellation](https://www.waves.com/tips-for-fixing-phase-problems-in-your-mix)
and other mono compatibility issues. Alternatively, if you're using something
like a mid/side compressor for widening (by reducing the volume of the mids,
and/or boosting the sides), make sure you check your mix on stereo speakers,
not just headphones, as I've found the change in listening environment from
what are effectively ear-mounted speakers to wider-spaced, further-away
speakers is sometimes necessary to identify whether things no longer gel.

I've used all three on the master bus in Stardust: an exciter, widening via
phase-based stereo expansion, and widening via boosting side volume.

There's Waves vintage exciter in front of my master EQ; my current master EQ of
choice - SlickEQ ME - has built-in low & high-frequency exciters with tunable
corner frequencies, and per-band & global stereo width controls (the cone with
"2.0 dB" above it in the bottom right); then finally, I've got the compressor
in Limiter 6 GE giving a 1 dB boost to the sides.

![Exciting!](/article-images/stardust/exciters.png)

Here's a little demo: the same section of the track repeated three times, first
without any widening or exciters, then with just the stereo widening, then with
widening plus exciters. Headphones on for maximum effect.

# Other Tricks

So other than the above, what other tricks did I employ? Well, other than the
ones related to track structure itself - the four-on-the-floor beat, the
repetitive vocal motif, the changing up of layers over time, etc. - there are
two things in particular I did that I think of as "tricks".

## Subtle Dissonance

If you've studied a little music theory but not really dived into
producing/composing your own material, you're probably aware that Dissonance Is
Bad. You want to choose your chords from the palette offered up by the key
you're in, and you want your melodic elements to harmonise nicely with those
chords. But sometimes a little selective dissonance, subtly employed, can
elevate things in a way that most people won't even notice: done right, things
just "sound better", though you'd be hard pressed to say why without the stems
or score in front of you.

Here are the first two chords used in the strings on Stardust:

![Spot the deliberate mistake](/article-images/stardust/dissonance.png)

Notice anything strange? The eagle-eyed among you may notice there's a G in
that B-flat major chord, and an A in the C major chord. Both chords are
octave-doubled; the G in the B-flat sits right up at the top, "extending" the
range of the chord a little, whereas the A in the C major replaces the G in
the lower triad, sitting right in the middle, more subtle. We're in D minor
here, and both serve to make a bog-standard VI-VII-I progression sound just a
little less vanilla.

Headphones on again! Here's that same VI-VII-I chord progression played twice,
first as bog-standard, harmony-obeying chords, then with the added dissonance.
Then I play the normal & dissonant VI chord a couple of times back-to-back just
to highlight the difference.

## Guitar Amps Aren't Just for Guitars

Staying with that string sound, another thing I did was run it through a guitar
amp & cabinet simulator. Nothing fancy, just the one that ships with Renoise.
But I think the end result is rather nice. You could probably replicate the
effect - or, at least, get very close - with a simple bit of EQ; a slight boost
to the lows, a slight cut to the mids... but it's not just about this one
particular end result, it's also about the process. There's a whole array of
different cabinet styles to choose from, along with wet/dry mix level, gain
(which, of course, is "overdrive" when pushed high enough), a built-in five
band EQ, and a choice of signal routings through amp, EQ, and cabinet.

If I've loaded up a bread & butter preset on a synth, and want to shake things
up a bit without spending hours on sound design, adding an amp cabinet and
spending a few minutes fiddling with the settings can often be just what it
needs.

One final audio demo: same strings, same chord progression; first with the amp
cabinet disabled, then again with it enabled. I don't think I even strayed far
from the effect's default settings: "All Classic" cabinet, not much gain, bit
of both wet and dry signals mixed in the output.

{{< audio src="/media/stardust/cabinet.mp3" >}}

As I said earlier, you could get most of the way there with just a touch of EQ,
but I prefer this method, and could have trivially taken things much further
if warranted. It just sounds a bit more... "cinematic", don't you think? Not
that the base sound isn't nice on its own.

# Smoke and Mirrors

Are these things really "tricks" if they actually work? Well, yes and no. In a
track like Stardust, where I deliberately made so many elements as basic as
possible in deliberate pursuit of style over substance, I'd say they're tricks:
hopefully they serve to make the finished result sound a little bit less like I
made it in my bedroom, although the individual elements have been the staple of
many a bedroom techno musician for decades. (Hopefully. I'm still learning
here.)

But the same tricks can, and I would argue should, be employed on more
musically complex material as well. Just because something has substance
doesn't mean it can't _also_ have style.
